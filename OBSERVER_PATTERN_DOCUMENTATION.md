# Observer Pattern Implementation in Support Module

## Overview

The Observer Pattern has been successfully implemented in the Support module to create a decoupled, extensible, and maintainable system for handling ticket-related events. This implementation allows for automatic notifications, logging, metrics tracking, and other side effects without tightly coupling these concerns to the core business logic.

## Pattern Structure

### Events (Subjects)

Events are fired when significant actions occur in the support system:

1. **TicketCreated** - When a new support ticket is created
2. **TicketStatusChanged** - When a ticket's status changes (open → in_progress → resolved, etc.)
3. **TicketAssigned** - When a ticket is assigned to an agent
4. **TicketReplyAdded** - When a reply is added to a ticket
5. **TicketEscalated** - When a ticket is escalated to higher priority
6. **TicketResolved** - When a ticket is marked as resolved

### Listeners (Observers)

Listeners respond to events and perform specific actions:

1. **NotifyCustomerTicketCreated** - Sends confirmation email to customer
2. **NotifyAdminsNewTicket** - Alerts admin users about new tickets
3. **SendTicketAssignmentNotification** - Notifies agents when tickets are assigned
4. **SendReplyNotification** - Sends notifications when replies are added
5. **UpdateTicketMetrics** - Updates dashboard metrics and analytics
6. **LogTicketActivity** - Logs all ticket activities for audit trail

### Notifications

Email and database notifications for different scenarios:

1. **TicketCreatedNotification** - Customer confirmation of ticket creation
2. **NewTicketNotification** - Admin alert for new tickets requiring attention
3. **TicketAssignedNotification** - Agent notification of ticket assignment
4. **TicketReplyNotification** - Notifications for new replies

## Implementation Details

### Event Classes

All events extend Laravel's base event classes and implement the Observer Pattern:

```php
// Example: TicketCreated Event
class TicketCreated
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

    public Ticket $ticket;

    public function __construct(Ticket $ticket)
    {
        $this->ticket = $ticket;
    }
}
```

### Model Integration

Models fire events automatically using Eloquent model events:

```php
// In Ticket model
protected static function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    static::created(function ($ticket) {
        TicketCreated::dispatch($ticket);
    });

    static::updated(function ($ticket) {
        if (isset($ticket->_statusChanged)) {
            TicketStatusChanged::dispatch(
                $ticket,
                $ticket->_statusChanged['old'],
                $ticket->_statusChanged['new']
            );
        }
    });
}
```

### Service Provider Registration

Events and listeners are registered in the `SupportServiceProvider`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    TicketCreated::class => [
        NotifyCustomerTicketCreated::class,
        NotifyAdminsNewTicket::class,
        LogTicketActivity::class . '@handleTicketCreated',
        UpdateTicketMetrics::class . '@handleTicketCreated',
    ],
    // ... more event → listener mappings
];
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Core business logic (ticket creation/updates) is separate from side effects (notifications, logging)
- Each listener has a single responsibility
- Models don't need to know about notification systems

### 2. **Extensibility**
- New listeners can be added without modifying existing code
- New events can be created for additional business requirements
- Easy to add features like SMS notifications, webhook calls, etc.

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Changes to notification logic don't affect core ticket functionality
- Each component is independently testable
- Clear separation makes debugging easier

### 4. **Performance**
- Listeners can be queued for background processing
- Heavy operations (email sending) don't block the main request
- Database updates and API calls can be processed asynchronously

### 5. **Testability**
- Events can be faked in tests
- Individual listeners can be tested in isolation
- Integration tests can verify the complete flow

## Event Flow Examples

### Creating a New Ticket

```
1. User creates ticket via API
2. Ticket model fires TicketCreated event
3. Multiple listeners respond:
   - NotifyCustomerTicketCreated: Sends confirmation email
   - NotifyAdminsNewTicket: Alerts admin users
   - LogTicketActivity: Records creation in audit log
   - UpdateTicketMetrics: Updates dashboard counters
```

### Assigning a Ticket

```
1. Admin assigns ticket to agent
2. Ticket model fires TicketAssigned event
3. Listeners respond:
   - SendTicketAssignmentNotification: Emails agent
   - LogTicketActivity: Records assignment
4. If status changed, TicketStatusChanged event also fires
```

### Adding a Reply

```
1. Agent/Customer adds reply
2. TicketReply model fires TicketReplyAdded event
3. Listeners respond:
   - SendReplyNotification: Notifies appropriate party
   - LogTicketActivity: Records reply in audit log
4. Model logic updates ticket status
5. TicketStatusChanged event fires if status changed
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Adding New Listeners

1. Create a new listener class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Modules\Support\Listeners;

use App\Modules\Support\Events\TicketCreated;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class CustomTicketHandler implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function handle(TicketCreated $event): void
    {
        // Your custom logic here
    }
}
```

2. Register in `SupportServiceProvider`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    TicketCreated::class => [
        // ... existing listeners
        CustomTicketHandler::class,
    ],
];
```

### Creating New Events

1. Create event class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Modules\Support\Events;

use App\Modules\Support\Models\Ticket;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;

class TicketReopened
{
    use Dispatchable;
    
    public Ticket $ticket;
    public string $reason;
    
    public function __construct(Ticket $ticket, string $reason)
    {
        $this->ticket = $ticket;
        $this->reason = $reason;
    }
}
```

2. Fire the event in your model:

```php
public function reopen(string $reason = 'Customer request'): void
{
    $this->update(['status' => 'open']);
    TicketReopened::dispatch($this, $reason);
}
```

### Queue Configuration

For production environments, configure listeners to run in background queues:

```php
// In listener classes
class NotifyCustomerTicketCreated implements ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue;
    
    public $queue = 'notifications';
    public $delay = 30; // Delay 30 seconds
    public $tries = 3;  // Retry 3 times
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging

All ticket activities are automatically logged to `storage/logs/support.log`:

```json
{
  "event": "ticket.created",
  "ticket_id": 123,
  "ticket_number": "TKT-2025-000123",
  "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
  "priority": "high",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Metrics Tracking

Listeners automatically update various metrics:

- Dashboard counters (total tickets, open tickets, etc.)
- Priority distribution
- Resolution time averages
- Agent performance statistics

### Failed Jobs

Monitor failed notification jobs in the `failed_jobs` table and retry using:

```bash
php artisan queue:retry all
```

## Testing

### Unit Testing Events

```php
public function test_ticket_created_event_is_fired()
{
    Event::fake();
    
    $ticket = Ticket::factory()->create();
    
    Event::assertDispatched(TicketCreated::class, function ($event) use ($ticket) {
        return $event->ticket->id === $ticket->id;
    });
}
```

### Integration Testing

```php
public function test_ticket_creation_sends_notifications()
{
    Notification::fake();
    
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $ticket = Ticket::factory()->create(['user_id' => $user->id]);
    
    Notification::assertSentTo(
        $user,
        TicketCreatedNotification::class
    );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Listeners Focused**: Each listener should have a single responsibility
2. **Use Queues**: Process heavy operations (email sending) in background
3. **Handle Failures**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. **Log Everything**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test both individual listeners and complete event flows
6. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for slow listeners that might block the system

## Future Enhancements

The Observer Pattern implementation makes it easy to add:

1. **Webhook Notifications**: Send events to external systems
2. **SMS Alerts**: For urgent tickets
3. **Slack Integration**: Team notifications
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time reporting and dashboards
5. **AI Integration**: Automatic ticket categorization and routing
6. **SLA Monitoring**: Automatic escalation based on response times

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable support system that can grow with your business needs.
