# Product Management Module - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Product Management Module for the Jewelry E-commerce System, incorporating the Decorator Design Pattern and following MVC architecture principles.

## Technologies and Practices Implemented

### 1. PHP and MySQL
- **PHP**: Laravel framework with modern PHP features
- **MySQL**: Database with proper relationships and constraints
- **ORM**: Laravel Eloquent for database operations

### 2. Design Patterns
- **Decorator Pattern**: Implemented for different product views (Admin vs Customer)
- **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: Through Laravel's Eloquent ORM

### 3. Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Laravel's built-in CSRF protection
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using Eloquent ORM
- **File Upload Security**: Proper file type and size validation

### 4. Web Service Technologies
- **RESTful API**: Clean API endpoints for product actions
- **JSON Responses**: Proper API response formatting
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for different operations

## Module Structure

### 1. Decorator Pattern Implementation

    public function getDisplayPrice(): float;
    public function getFormattedDescription(): string;
    public function getCategoryDisplay(): string;
    public function getPublishInfo(): array;
}
```

#### Admin Product Decorator
- Enhanced data for admin management
- Publishing status controls
- Detailed product information
- Action permissions (publish, unpublish, delete)

#### Customer Product Decorator
- Customer-friendly display data
- Shopping cart integration
- Wishlist functionality
- Review and rating system

### 2. Database Schema

#### Products Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name (Product Name)
- sku (Stock Keeping Unit)
- description (Basic Description)
- marketing_description (Marketing Copy)
- price (Regular Price)
- discount_price (Sale Price)
- inventory_id (Foreign Key to Inventory)
- image_path (Main Image)
