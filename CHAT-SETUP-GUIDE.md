# Real-Time Chat System Setup & Fix

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Channel Name Mismatch**: Fixed MessageSent event to broadcast on `conversation.{id}` channel to match JavaScript listener
2. **Loading Chat Issue**: Fixed JavaScript to properly handle queue status and remove "Loading Chat..." immediately
3. **Route Corrections**: Ensured proper API routes are used for fetching messages
4. **Queue Status Display**: Improved queue status showing and polling logic

## Required Setup Steps:

### 1. Environment Configuration
Add these to your `.env` file if missing:
```
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb
REVERB_APP_KEY=reverb-key
REVERB_APP_SECRET=reverb-secret  
REVERB_APP_ID=reverb-app-id
REVERB_HOST=localhost
REVERB_PORT=8081
REVERB_SCHEME=http
```

### 2. Start Reverb Server
Run this command in a separate terminal:
```bash
php artisan reverb:start
```

### 3. Compile Assets  
Make sure JavaScript assets are compiled:
```bash
npm run dev
# or for production:
npm run build
```

### 4. Test the System
Run the test script:
```bash
php test-chat.php
```

## Workflow Now Works As:

1. **Customer clicks "Chat with Agent"**
   - Shows "Starting Chat..." instead of "Loading Chat..."
   - Calls `/chat/start` endpoint
   - Gets added to queue OR resumes existing conversation

2. **Queue System**  
   - If no active conversation, customer enters queue
   - Shows position and estimated wait time
   - Customer can send messages while waiting
   - Polls every 5 seconds for queue status updates

3. **Agent Assignment**
   - Agents see pending chats in admin queue dashboard
   - Can manually accept chats from queue
   - Real-time updates when agent accepts

4. **Real-Time Messaging**
   - Uses Laravel Echo with Reverb 
   - Messages broadcast on `conversation.{id}` channel
   - Both customer and agent see messages in real-time

5. **End Chat**
   - Both customer and agent have "End Chat" button
   - Creates system message when terminated
   - Disables input and shows termination notice
   - Updates conversation status to 'completed'

## Key Files Modified:

1. `app/Modules/Support/Events/MessageSent.php` - Fixed channel name
2. `resources/views/components/chat-widget.blade.php` - Fixed loading and queue logic
3. `test-chat.php` - Created for testing system components

## Important Notes:

- **Reverb Server Must Be Running** on port 8081 for real-time features
- Queue system requires manual agent acceptance (auto-assignment is disabled)
- All conversations are logged and can be viewed in chat history
- System message are sent when conversations are terminated
