# Chat System Fixes - All Issues Resolved âœ…

## Issue 1: Chat History "Continue Chat" Logic Fixed
**Problem**: "Continue Chat" button showed for all conversations with `status === 'active'`, even if they weren't actually active with an agent.

**Solution**: Updated the button logic in `resources/views/chat-history/index.blade.php`:
```php
// OLD: Only checked status
@if($conversation->status === 'active')

// NEW: Checks status, end date, AND agent assignment
@if($conversation->status === 'active' && !$conversation->ended_at && $conversation->assigned_agent_id)
    <button>Continue Chat</button>
@elseif($conversation->status === 'active' && !$conversation->ended_at && !$conversation->assigned_agent_id)
    <span>Waiting for Agent</span>
@endif
```

**Result**: 
- "Continue Chat" only shows for truly active conversations with assigned agents
- "Waiting for Agent" shows for conversations that are active but unassigned
- No button shows for terminated conversations

## Issue 2: Queue End Logic Fixed
**Problem**: When customers left the queue after sending messages, it incorrectly showed "Connected to Agent" even though no agent was assigned.

**Solution**: Enhanced queue polling and leave queue logic:

1. **Improved Queue Polling** (`startQueuePolling`):
   - Added check for manual queue leave: `if (chatMessages.innerHTML.includes('Left Queue'))`
   - Prevents polling from overriding manual leave actions

2. **Enhanced Leave Queue Function** (`leaveQueue`):
   - Clears polling interval immediately: `clearInterval(window.queueCheckInterval)`
   - Shows proper "Left Queue" message instead of "Connected to Agent"
   - Cleans up Echo channels to prevent message leakage
   - Properly clears conversation data

**Result**: Customers who leave the queue see "Left Queue" message instead of incorrect "Connected to Agent" status.

## Issue 3: Real-time Messaging on Customer Side Fixed
**Problem**: Admin could see real-time messages but customers couldn't receive messages from agents.

**Solution**: Completely overhauled Echo listener system:

1. **Enhanced Message Listener** (`listenForMessages`):
   ```javascript
   // Added channel cleanup
   if (window.currentEchoChannel) {
       window.Echo.leaveChannel(window.currentEchoChannel);
   }
   
   // Better message handling
   .listen('MessageSent', (e) => {
       console.log('ðŸ“¨ Received MessageSent event:', e);
       if (e.message && e.message.user) {
           if (e.message.user.id !== currentUserId) {
               addMessageToBox(e.message);
           }
       }
   })
   ```

2. **Channel Management**:
   - Tracks current channel: `window.currentEchoChannel = channelName`
   - Prevents duplicate subscriptions
   - Proper cleanup on terminate/leave
   - Added error handling and detailed logging

3. **Cleanup on Actions**:
   - `leaveQueue()`: Unsubscribes from Echo channels
   - `terminateChat()`: Properly cleans up channels  
   - `handleConversationTerminated()`: Clears channel references

**Result**: 
- Customers now receive real-time messages from agents
- No duplicate subscriptions or memory leaks
- Proper channel cleanup prevents cross-conversation message bleeding
- Enhanced logging for debugging
